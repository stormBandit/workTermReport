                                    I would like to gain a much more indepth understanding of how web sites work with a
                                    server and a database in order to create an efficient and effective environment. I want
                                    to expand my knowledge of the different languages used in web development such as Php,
                                    javascript, css, jquery and I would like a deeper understand of mySql.

                                    I believe I have come a long way with my own knowledge of many of the systems I
                                    mentioned in my goal. I have a much better understanding of how websites work and
                                    have expanded my knowdlege of PhP, MySql, javascript and css as I had hoped. I have
                                    been building a website throughout this term  to use as both a training tool for
                                    myself and a work term report to be graded for co-op. Being successful in this build
                                    shows that I have accomplished my goal.

                                    I would like to become better at communicating with others about systems and
                                    processes within the system. I find that when colleagues of mine are speaking in
                                    depth about how a system works I can become lost. As well when I try to explain
                                    myself to others I can confuse even myself in trying to explain how something I
                                    have developed works.

                                    Each day at Tulip we do a scrum where the team gets together and we share what we
                                    were working on the previous day as well as what we will be working on today. Scrum
                                    gives us ll a good chance to catch up with eachother, learn about other parts of
                                    the project and ask questions to clarify misunderstandings. I will take full
                                    advantage of these scrum sessions in order to improve my oral communication

                                    The best way to measure whether or not I have become a better oral communicator is
                                    within those scrum sessions, when I explain my process to others and realize that
                                    they are following along and understand what i mean, then i will feel like I have
                                    achieved this goal. Although it is always something that can be improved

                                    I believe that I have become a much more effective communicator, and that my
                                    questions have become much more efficient. I am able to more efficiently find the
                                    answers I need in order to solve my problem, and I am much better at targeting my
                                    questions at the right person. I also feel that because of this I am more often able
                                    to find the answers to my own questions through searching more effectively with online
                                    resources.

                                    The system I am working with here at Tulip is very large, sometimes it is extremely
                                    difficult to read the code and understand what is going on, this is a skill I would
                                    like to develop. It is important to be able to read old code, know how it works and
                                    what it is doing, to the be able to modify that code.

                                    The best way to get better at something is to practice. Reading and understanding
                                    old code is something we must do every time we are given a new task, so I believe
                                    there is plenty of time in this work term for me to practice and refine this skill.

                                    This skill is one that will be difficut to measure, by the end of the term I should
                                    be familiar with the structure of the code and the conventions used, which will aid
                                    me in understanding the code. If I am still unable to read a function and not
                                    understand what it is used for then I will have not accomplished this goal.

                                    I believe being able to read and comprehend old code or code written by someone else
                                    is a skill that can be constantly developed and it is not something that can be
                                    taught. One great benefit to me with this co-op position was that a lot of the code
                                    I worked with was written by a multitude of authors, this opened my eyes to how
                                    difficult reading old code can be. This also gave me an excellent opportunity to
                                    work on this goal. I feel that my skill in this area did improve but can always be
                                    improved more and this will enable me to fix bugs and implement new features more
                                    efficiently.

                                    I would also like to start reading a few more of those articles that I get emailed
                                    to me every month that I normally just skim through and toss in my trash.

                                    This is a hard goal to measure, in terms of this goal I really think that it will
                                    be more of a self evaluated kind of goal. I think if I ask enough questions to
                                    expand my global understanding of how certain processes work then I will have
                                    achieved this goal.

                                    This skill is one that will be difficult to measure, by the end of the term I should
                                    be familiar with the structure of the code and the conventions used, which will aid
                                    me in understanding the code. If I am still unable to read a function and not

                                    This is probably the hardest goal I made for myself for this term, and if im being
                                    honest, the goal that I failed at the most. This is a very hard goal to accomplish
                                    in a short amount of time. I feel like the best thing I did to work towards this goal
                                    was having conversations with my colleagues at Tulip. The people there were always
                                    willing to share their knowledge and explain concepts that I did not understand.
                                    I liked to discuss different concepts with colleagues and learn from their experiences
                                    with different systems, and try to gain insight on the most effective ways to
                                    accomplish tasks.

                                    One of the goals I am most ambitious to meet, but also may take the longest time to
                                    accomplish, is being more independent. I would like to be able to sit down, start a
                                    project and complete that project without needing aid from other people. I find that
                                    I am unable to do highly complex things without the help of another person that I
                                    can explain my questions to and they can answer them. It is a problem of not really
                                    knowing what im trying to do (or what the industry calls that thing) to be able to
                                    look it up myself.
