    <p>Tulip Retail was an incredible place to work, I was fortunate to experience the rich culture of
        a tech startup in the heart of Toronto. Being my first co-op job I did not know what to expect
        at any workplace. The culture of a tech startup such as Tulip is very different from what I
        had expected. I believe everyone should take the opportunity to experience this easy going and
        open culture. The biggest surprise that I encountered was the openness among the company, we would
        have weekly updates about what was going on in the company. These updates would include an update
        about plans for the future of the company and overall management decisions. In any other company
        I have worked at in the passed these are not the sorts of topics that are discussed with all staff
        and are more kept on a need to know basis. This was an incredible learning experience for me.
        <br><br>
        The benefits of working in a startup doesn't just end with the culture, there was an immense amount
        of support and encouragement given by all members of the team. The support I was shown from my
        co-workers was something I could never have imagined. I worked on a team of three, where two of us
        were co-op students. Sometimes my manager would be too busy, managing, but I would still be able to
        find the assistance I needed to complete a task through other channels in the company.
        Being my first co-op position this was a huge advantage to me, enabling me to learn a vast amount of
        skills and expand my knowledge of many different topics. People at Tulip were very friendly and often
        times I found myself learning more from them about different software applications than I learn from
        my professors in school.
        <br><br>
        I met some amazing and very talented people working at Tulip and would recommend working here to anyone
        looking for a fun, challenging and rewarding workplace :D
