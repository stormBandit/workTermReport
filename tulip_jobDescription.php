        My Time at Tulip:<br>
        During my 4 month co-op at Tulip I worked on a team which serviced the client <a href="https://well.ca">well.ca</a>
        the team consisted of myself, another co-op and our manager. The small team dynamic meant that we all had to
        be able to deal with all components of the very large and intricate website.
