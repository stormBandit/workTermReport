        <p class="pager">I am coop student at the university of Guelph, currently working towards a bachelors of computing
            with a major in Computer Science and a Minor in Business. I have just completed my first work term
            with Tulip Retail in Toronto. Throughout the 4 month work term I was able to use many of the skills I learned
            in the classroom to assist me in accomplishing tasks in timely manners.
            I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge in a hands on environment, which I feel is extremely
            valuable and will help me grow in my career.
            I hope to use my future work terms to try out new areas of the industry and expand my knowledge,
            I have a particular interest in cyber security, hardware, artificial intelligence systems and code optimizations.
